## Welcome to the Specification Inference Project

The SpecGuru project is a collaborative project of [Iowa State University (ISU)](http://iastate.edu),
[Bowling Green State University (BGSU)](http://bgsu.edu), the [University of Central Florida (UCF)](http://www.ucf.edu)
the [Penn State University (PSU)](http://psu.edu), and the [University of Texas, Dallas (UT Dallas)](http://utdallas.edu).
The overall project PI is [Dr. Hridesh Rajan](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh) at 
[Iowa State University, Department of Computer Science](http://cs.iastate.edu). 
The BGSU site is led by [Dr. Robert Dyer](https://www.cs.bgsu.edu/rdyer/).
The UCF site is led by [Dr. Gary T. Leavens](https://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/).
The PSU site is led by [Dr. Vasant G. Honavar](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/vhonavar/).
The UT Dallas site is led by [Dr. Tien N. Nguyen](www.utdallas.edu/~tien.n.nguyen/).

### Problems and Goals

Despite their proven benefits, useful, comprehensible, and efficiently checkable 
specifications are not widely available. This is primarily because writing useful, 
non-trivial specifications from scratch is too hard, time consuming, and requires 
expertise that is not broadly available. Furthermore, the lack of specifications 
for widely-used libraries and frameworks, caused by the high cost of writing 
specifications, tends to have a snowball effect. 
Core libraries lack specifications, which makes specifying applications that use 
them expensive. 

To contain the skyrocketing development and maintenance costs of high assurance systems, 
this self-perpetuating cycle must be broken. The labor cost of specifying programs 
can be significantly decreased via advances in specification inference and synthesis, 
and this has been attempted several times, but with limited success. 
We believe that practical specification inference and synthesis is an idea whose 
time has come. Fundamental breakthroughs in this area can be achieved by leveraging 
the collective intelligence available in software artifacts from millions of open 
source projects. Fine-grained access to such data sets has been unprecedented, but 
is now easily available. In this project we are making advances in specification 
inference that can be had by using such data sets to infer specifications.
